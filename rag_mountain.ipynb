       "\"<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and small particles in the air—primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Sunlight consists of a spectrum of colors, but when it scatters through the atmosphere at smaller angles (like directly overhead), most of red, orange, yellow light is scattered away. Blue light has a shorter wavelength, which is scattered more often by the molecules in the air.\\n\\nAs a result, we see blue when looking towards the horizon or upwards rather than downwards. The phenomenon explains why sunsets are red—because sunlight has to pass through more atmosphere layers to reach our eyes at lower altitudes where the Sun is setting, scattering those longer wavelengths of light away.\""
